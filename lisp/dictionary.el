;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Interface for Dictionary.app
;;
;; Translation word by Dictionary.app, and display translation use
;; buffer.
;;
;; Below are commands you can use:
;; `dictionary-search-word'
;; Search word from input via minibuffer
;; `dictionary-search-pointer'
;; Search word under pointer (cursor)
;;
;; Tips:
;;
;; If current mark is active, dictionary commands will translate
;; region string, otherwise translate word around point.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put dictionary.el to your `load-path'.
;; And the following to your Emacs initialization file
;;
;; (require 'dictionary)
;; Example key binding
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") 'dictionary-search-pointer)
